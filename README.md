# Common

Common is an unofficial open source implementation of common utility classes
and routines found in World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King circa 2010.
These utility classes and routines were not part of the standard libraries
used for the game, and are assumed to be specific to World of Warcraft, unlike
Storm, Tempest, and so on.

This project attempts to provide a version of these common utility classes and
routines compatible with the final release build of World of Warcraft: Wrath
of the Lich King in 2010: 3.3.5a (12340).

In the spirit of documenting what is presumed to have existed at the time,
this project makes every attempt to maintain the canonical names, layouts, and
side effects of the original implementation of these common utility classes
and routines. At the same time, it attempts to ensure portability and
compatibility with modern 64-bit systems.

## FAQ

**Why?**

It's fascinating to explore the development practices used to build a modern
major video game.

**Why 3.3.5a?**

The game and its libraries have become significantly more complex in the
intervening 10+ years. By picking 3.3.5a, it's possible to imagine this
implementation will eventually be complete.

**Will this let me cheat in the game?**

No. Common is a library of utility classes and routines, none of which are
particularly relevant to the anti-cheat measures found in the game.

**Can I use this in my own development projects?**

It's probably a bad idea. The original utility classes and routines remain
closed source, and this  project is in no way official.
